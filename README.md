# Clock
Hello People, Welcome to my Github Repository.
My idea here with this project is to design a clock application as we have in our applications. This really helped me in testing my UI/UX skills. Though there is quite a lot of learning and improvements and will be adding the further in the near future.
As on today's date (18/1/22) I have successfully completed the Stopwatch functionality of clock, Please check the master branch for my code and logic.
Share your code,design or feedbacks with me,will be glad to listen.
Thank you for taking out the time ðŸ˜Š
